	<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">This file tests most HTML tags and some XHTML and CSS features as well. It's not intended to be a complete guide, though it may serve as a basis for such a document if someone feels inclined to write it.</p>
	<p align="justify">There are a number of ways to create content for the REB1200, most based on approximate conversion with more or less predictable results. But if you want the most control, this is the way to go. Unfortunately at this time, it is dependend on SBpublisher 1.5, a somewhat dated piece of software.</p>
	<p align="justify">There are a number of non-standard behaviours, which may be due to SBpublisher's interpretation as much as quirks in the actual REB1200 firmware. Updated firmware, as well as new tools to turn (X)HTML into REB's native .imp format may change that. This document might also help tracking those changes.</p>
	<p align="justify">The original 'testbed' for this document was a REB1200 firmware 2.0, with files hand-written in VIm and generated by SBpublisher 1.5 via html2sb.exe.</p>
	<p align="justify">Use the 'Table of Contents' function to access it on the REB.</p>
	<p align="justify">A word of warning:</p>
	<p align="justify">If SBpublisher doesn't like something in your source or the .opf file that goes with it, it will overwrite your files without warning, completely disrupting your sourcefile formatting (removing indentations, adding hard line breaks etc.)</p>
	<p align="justify">So: Never run htmlsb.exe/SBpublisher on your original files, always use a copy! Don't forget to use HTMLtidy for clean code!</p>

	<p>Click <a href="REBTD-external.html">HERE</a> to go a separate HTML file.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Click on the image to go there as well:</p>
	<p align="center"><a href="REBTD-external.html"><img src="ebooklogo.gif" width="153" height="61" alt="eBook Logo - External Link" /></a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p id="return-external">BACK to this page from the external document.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">Note that image-maps are not supported at this, one solution being to split up the original image into parts which have their own separate links.</p>
	<p>Another link: Click below to go to the TOC:</p>

	<p align="center"><a href="REBTD-TOC.html">TABLE OF CONTENTS</a>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">Traditional anchors (a name="back-here") work just fine, but the 'id="back-here"' method works well and is the more elegant solution.</p>
