REBTestDocument.imp is a testbed document created by 'Ludo'
specifically specifically for the REB 1200 and was posted to the
REB1200 Yahoo group in 2002.  It is in the public domain.

REBtestdoc-ETI.RES is an unpacked .RES directory created by opening
the REBTestDocument.imp file in the official eBook Technologies,
Inc. 'eBook Viewer' application (version 2.2, ROM version 3.1), and
then copying the temporary .RES directory it created in
"%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp".  As such, it can be considered a
canonical unpacking of the REBTestDocument.imp file for testing
purposes.
