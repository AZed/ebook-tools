      <p ><b class="first" >T</b>he Solar System can be divided into
      two planetary divisions. Divided based upon the distance from
      the Sun and physical <a href="" >characteristics</a>, the inner
      planets are termed terrestrial while the outer are respectively
      termed Jovian planets.</p>

      <p >Characteristically, the inner planets share comparable
      sizes, densities, and structures. The composition of these
      worlds is rocky in nature with high boiling points. Originating
      from a concentration of hydrogen and helium gas and dust, the
      Solar System with terrestrial planets emerged.</p>

      <p >Further, the light compounds that formed the terrestrial
      planets soon vaporized by their close proximity to the Sun’s
      heat.</p>

      <p >&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p ><b class="first" >C</b>oincidentally, the Jovian planets
      retained the lighter and colder gases within their compositions
      because of their distance.</p>
      
      <p >Moreover, the Jovian planets seem far more massive than the
      closer planets and are able to hold hydrogen, water, ammonia,
      and methane within their icy atmospheres.</p>
