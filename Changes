Release Notes
=============

 * Mobipocket HUFF/CDIC support
 * Unpacking DRM-protected Mobipocket files now just skips the
   encrypted text, but still extracts the unencrypted images
 * EBook::Tools now takes advantage of several external helper files,
   if they are made available:
   * Mobipocket generation possible if mobigen is available
   * Unpacking interface supports MS Reader (.lit) if convertlit is available
   * Downconverting interface supports MS Reader and Mobipocket if
     convertlit and MobiDeDRM are available, respectively.

   instead of just returning 1
 * Unpack.pm: gen_metadata() no longer calls split_metadata() if the

   exists (this isn't mandated by the standard, but mobigen requires
   it)
