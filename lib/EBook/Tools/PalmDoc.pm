=head1 NAME

EBook::Tools::PalmDoc - Palm::PDB handler for manipulating the PalmDoc/PilotDoc/AportisDoc format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use EBook::Tools::PalmDoc qw(uncompress_palmdoc);
 use Palm::PDB;
 
 my $pdb = Palm::PDB->new();

or 

 use EBook::Tools::PalmDoc qw(:all);

 my $pdb = EBook::Tools::PalmDoc->new();
 $pdb->set_text($text);
 $pdb->Write('textfile.pdb');
 
 my $pdb2 = EBook::Tools::PalmDoc->new();
 $pdb2->{attributes}{resource} = 1;
 $pdb->import_textfile('textfile.txt');
 $pdb->Write('textfile.prc');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains a L<Palm::PDB> handler (subclassed from
L<Palm::Raw>) and some associated general procedures for dealing with
PalmDoc books.  This handles PalmDoc and only PalmDoc.  For
Mobipocket, eReader, or other .pdb/.prc formats, see the module
specific to the format.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 C<new()>

Instantiates a new Ebook::Tools::PalmDoc object.  To create a Palm
Resource file instead of a Palm Database file, set
C<$self->{attributes}{resource}> to be true immediately after
construction.

Create a new Doc object. By default, it's not a resource database. Setting
C<$self->{attributes}{resource}> to C<1> before any manipulations will
cause it to become a resource database.

=head1 MODIFIER METHODS

These methods have two naming/capitalization schemes -- methods
directly related to the subclassing of Palm::PDB use its
MethodName capitalization style.  Any other methods are
lowercase_with_underscores for consistency with the rest of
EBook::Tools.


=head2 C<ParseRecord(%record)>

Parses PDB records, updating the object attributes.  This method is
called automatically on every database record (in .pdb files) during
C<Load()>.

Parses bookmark records/resources, updating object attributes, most

=head2 C<parse_palmdoc_header($data)>

Takes as an argument a scalar containing the 16 bytes of the PalmDoc
header (also used by Mobipocket).  Returns a hashref containing those
values keyed to recognizable names.

See:

http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/DOC#PalmDOC

and

http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/MOBI

=head3 keys

The returned hashref will have the following keys:

=over

=item * C<compression>

Possible values:

=over

=item 1 - no compression

=item 2 - PalmDoc compression

=item 128 - iSilo3?

=item 17480 (the characters 'DH') - Mobipocket 'Dictionary Huffman'
compression (aka HuffDic aka Huff/CDIC)

=back

A warning will be carped if an unknown value is found.

=item * C<textlength>

Uncompressed length of book text in bytes

=item * C<textrecords>

Number of PDB records used for book text

=item * C<recordsize>

Maximum size of each record containing book text. This should always
be 2048 (for some Mobipocket files) or 4096 (for everything else).  A
warning will be carped if it isn't.

=item * C<spare>

Two bytes that should always be zero.  A warning will be carped if
they aren't.

=item * C<unknown12>

32 bits of unknown data, generally zero.  This key may be changed
later if more information is discovered.  Use with caution.

=back

Note that the current position component of the header is discarded.

=head2 C<uncompress_palmdoc($data)>

Uncompresses data compressed using the simplified Lempel-Ziv 77 scheme
used by PalmDoc and some other formats, and returns the uncompressed
string.

If an error is encountered during uncompression outputs a debug
message and returns undef.

=head3 Algorithm

The decoding mechanism is as follows:

Start by reading a byte from the compressed stream.  If the byte is:

=over

=item * 0x00: copy unmodified

=item * 0x01 to 0x08: "Type A" command

This specifies that the next 1-8 bytes are to be copied unmodified.

=item * 0x09 to 0x7f: copy unmodified

=item * 0x80 to 0xbf: "Type B" command

This specifies that the 16 bits (two characters) starting at that
point represent a length-offset pair.  Of the 16 bits that make up
these two bytes, the two leftmost bits (which should be '10') are
simply an identifier and are discarded.  The next 11 bits encode the
offset backwards from the end of uncompressed text, and the last three
encode the length of text to copy from that point (copying n+3 bytes).

=item * 0xc0 to 0xff: "Type C" command

This compresses spaces with the next character, with the value of that
character being XORed with 0x80.

=head1 BUGS

=over

=item * There isn't really any good way to detect the encoding from a
PalmDoc file, and I haven't even tried.  You may have some luck with
L<Encode::Detect>.  On top of this, the encodings aren't entirely
conformant with what you might expect, and vary by version of PalmOS.
See:

L<http://www.df.lth.se/~triad/krad/recode/palm.html>

for details.

=item * PalmDoc files in resource (.prc) form are almost entirely
untested.  Use at your own risk (but feel free to file bug reports).

=item * Although bookmarks can be extracted, they cannot be added to a
new file.

=item * Unit tests are unwritten.
