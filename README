EBook-Tools
===========

EBook-Tools contains a library and a command-line tool for unpacking,
creating, correcting, and repacking electronic books.

Current unpacking support is limited to PalmDoc and Mobipocket and
generation is limited to EPub.  The metadata correction tools are
quite extensive, however.  For more details, see the POD information
on EBook::Tools and EBook::Tools::Unpack.
